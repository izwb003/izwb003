* ⏯️Enthusiast in multimedia. (🤣But he even doesn't know the structure of MPEG4 yet.)
* 📖Is learning Qt, CSS and JavaScript now. (🤬Why doesn't his school teach him these things, but instead teaching stupid stdio every day?)

### In one word...

This guy is a technican, driven by his own hobbies since he was very young. Until today, although he is not doing well, he is still trying his best, no matter what he paid. He always defines himself as a "rubbish person", believing that everyone is doing better than him, but he is always striving to become better. He and others in his age group do not share common interests, hobbies, and topics, which makes him very awkward and therefore he is very isolated. He has almost no friends and is very afraid of socializing, but everyone he considers as a friend is supporting and encouraging him. He doesn't know much, but as long as it's the knowledge he knows, he's definitely willing to share it and hope it can help more people.

That's me, appearing on the internet with the name of @izwb003. I know that after reading my profile, you will think that I am an ordinary person who has not made any achievements, but I believe that if you are willing to open my profile page again in the future, you will see my progress. It may not be big, but there will always be.

Finally, thank you very much for being willing to check my profile page and discovering me in the corner of the internet. I have nothing to thank you for, so I wish you a wonderful day!😉
